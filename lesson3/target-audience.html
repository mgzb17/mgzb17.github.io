                    The RainShine Weather app can help her decide if it is still a good idea to celebrate her wedding outdoors. Through the app, she was able to 
                    tell the owner of the venue what her plans are.

                <h2>Persona #2: Mario Cruz</h2>

                <p>Mario is the Young Men's President in his ward in Hawaii for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is 34 years old and loves to go camping.
                    One Sunday, the boys were asking him that they want to go camping. He's been wanting to take them camping so he was really excited when they reached out.
                    They live in the city of Kane'ohe which is in the windward side of the island of O'ahu. Contrary to people's belief that it is always summer in Hawaii,
                    there is a reason why it is so green. That is because it rains a lot. The RainShine Weather app can help him decide when it is safe to go camping. It will give him
                    an idea if the rain will be too much for the young men.
